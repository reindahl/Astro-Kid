\section{Conclusion}

the problems with fd illustrates some of the weakess for gennereal purpose planners and strenghts



\subsection{Future Work}
%hvad skal der til for at pddl kan underst√∏tte domainet optimalt....

	it could be interesting to see how the complete Astro Kid domain could be supported by PDDL. the main problem to achieve this is the concurrency created by the continuous actions.
	
	
	this could be achieve by either extending the language or switching to a multi agent version of PDDL

	
	the idear of switching to a multi agent version fx. MA-PDDL is to threat all objects that can be involved in continuous actions and treating them as independent agents. this could help handling the concurrency issues and thereby allowing the planner to solve levels where this is an issue such as level...
